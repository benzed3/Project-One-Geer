# Project-One-Geer

### This is my part of the group project. I focused on the front end and backend.

### The purpose was to add the events onto each card, and give users six events in the Charlotte area.

### Updating the events was a challenge, particulary using the APIs, but updating code keeps the app running.

### This part of the project is mainted by me, and I can be reached at benzed3@gmail.com.
